# MySteps

This is an Android Health tracking app developed at the last year of my honours degree to assist my research work.  
The aim of this app is to help people make running a habit.  
Key data tracked is user's daily steps walked.   

## How it helps people foster the habit of running
If a user use the app, he/she is arranged into a group by the admin through admin panel. Individual steps goal and Group steps goal are assigned to the user and his/her group.   
Users compete with each other with their number of steps. Same rules apply to different groups. People compete and cooperate with each other. User's interest is stimulated in this way.  

## Main functionalities
* A dashboard displays all group members' current steps count.
